# File-Extension-Changer

Changes the extension of files or removes extensions. This can be done in bulk or in singles.

Handy if you got the visus that locks you out and changes file extensions.

In search box type extension you wish to look for

In Change box, type what you wish to change it to, or else, leave it blank and press remove and it will remove the extension.

No need to add "." to extension as it is done automatically.
